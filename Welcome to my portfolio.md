My name is Alex Karapetkov. I'm currently studying computer science at James Madison University and plan on graduating in May 2024 with a Bachelor of Science in CS along with minors in Asian Studies and History. This portfolio is meant to showcase some of the projects, both academic and personal, that I have completed in the last few years and some that I am still working on. They range from web applications made with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to the modeling of computer hardware, such as an ALU and program counter, using hardware description languages like Verilog.
