Hi, I'm Alex Karapetkov. I'm a Computer Science graduate from James Madison University (2024) focused on secure, user-centered solutions across cybersecurity, low-code development, software development, and IT infrastructure.

I hold certifications including CompTIA Security+ and CASP+, Microsoft Power Platform Fundamentals, along with specialized training in TCM Security's SOC 101 course and Microsoft's Power Up Program. My technical experience spans tools like Wireshark, Snort, and Nmap; systems such as Active Directory and Splunk; and platforms including Power Apps, Power Automate, Power BI, and Dataverse.

This portfolio showcases a mix of academic and personal projects, from a Bash-like command line shell built in C to hardware modeling with Verilog and business applications developed with the Microsoft Power Platform.

I'm currently exploring opportunities in cybersecurity, software development, IT support, and Power Apps development. If you'd like to connect, collaborate, or just say hi, feel free to reach out to me on LinkedIn.
