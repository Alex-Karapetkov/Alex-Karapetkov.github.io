My name is Alex Karapetkov. I graduated with a Computer Science degree from James Madison University in May 2024. This portfolio is meant to showcase some of the projects, both academic and personal, that I have completed in the last few years and some that I am still working on. They range from web applications made with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to the modeling of computer hardware, such as an ALU and program counter, using hardware description languages like Verilog.
